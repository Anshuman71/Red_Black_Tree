# RED_BLACK_TREE
### COMPLETE RED BLACK TREE WITH ANALYSIS AND DOCUMENTED MODULES


#### Description: 
                This project consists of creation of a red-black tree under c++03 standards with documentary
                comments, so anyone having idea with a minimum of C++03 is good to go. The project consists
                of atomic, fundamental and application based operations with RBT. 
                
                Also the modules are very readable with appropriate variables name so any one who 
                didn't know about c++ and is from different language but have a good grasp of OOPs
                and trees can easily get the intiution of the driving engine i.e., the algorithm 
                for every operation on RBT.
                
                
#### Prerequisites: 
                Atleast C++03, Pointers, OOP and basics of BST.

Note: Keep everything within same folder otherwise you have to give the complete path for custom headers
